# CougarPantry
Project to order CSUSM's Cougar Pantry
Cougar Pantry is about giving out free food to all members of the CSUSM 
community. 
We are going to build them a website that will show the data they use on a 
yearly basis. This data will include things such as amount of students who
use Cougar Pantry services, amount of money spent on food, which food gets 
used more, etc. 
This is a work in progress by Fab Fridays finest.
